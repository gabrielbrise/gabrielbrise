# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel Brise

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong background in React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and cloud infrastructure. Formerly an architect, I transitioned into software with a focus on clean, scalable, and user-centric web applications.

I've worked remotely for European companies, contributed to social media analytics platforms, and currently develop an indie tower defense game available on Steam.
